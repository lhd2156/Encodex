# Encodex

Encodex is a secure document storage web application designed for individuals and teams who need to safely store, organize, and access important documents from anywhere. The platform uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that only you and those you choose to share with can access your files—cloud providers and third parties cannot view your data.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Encryption:** All documents are encrypted before upload, guaranteeing privacy and security.
- **Multi-Device Access:** Access your documents securely from any device, anywhere.

- **Secure Sharing:** Share documents with trusted individuals, with granular access controls.
- **Signature Support (Planned):** Collect signatures on documents for added functionality.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple, modern UI for easy document management.
